## Summary
The analysis utilized the Brazilian e-commerce platform, Magist, as a possible potential strategic partner for ENIAC, a familiar technology company entering the Brazilian market. The analysis began with an investigation of Magist on three components from April 2017 through March 2018, namely delivery and logistics, seller performance, and product reviews. The hope was to provide ENIAC with valuable counsel regarding its market entry, and noteworthy suggestions for opportunities for cooperation via an e-commerce platform. This required the team to build Tableau¬Æ dashboards, schedule SQL queries, and export raw data to answer various business questions pertaining to delivery success, best-selling products, and the market potential for technology items on Magist. It also required a review of external market data in order to finalize and complete the analysis. All results were represented graphically, and we sent out drafts for feedback. In conclusion, Brazil is a viable market for ENIAC, and Magist would be an ideal partner as long as the strategic partner conditions are satisfied.

A significant challenge during this project was the use of the new tools for the first time. There was a lot of new learning involved as I tried to learn the technical aspects of SQL, Tableau, and Google Slides. However, as I developed the strategies of continuously practicing, researching, and working together with my colleagues, I was able to overcome the challenges I faced with these tools and begin to use them as part of the project process.
## Additional Reflections
Data Compatibility Assessment: The initial analysis which was undertaken identified that the figures where not fully compatible with EINIAC; was an example over-whelming almost, of good technical skills with regards to compatibilities and integrations that was employed in the analysis and final recommendations.

Data Visualization and Communication: Conveying what was a relatively complex finding from data that ultimately translated into simple insights to actionable elements for the business audience highlighted the need to communicate with your audience through effective use of data visualization and presentation style utilizing Tableau and Google Slides skills.
